# High_school
This repository contains programs that I made in high school. The programs may not be that impressive, however, I'm proud of the work and effort I went through to learn programming and make these programs. There are both programs that I made in school time as well as in my free time.

Here is the link to the files in Google Drive since the file size was too big for GitHub:
